# Booked
Booked acts as a medium for students to sell and buy books from other students. 

Booked was a weekend project I worked on with three other people for a Hackathon hosted at Morgan State University and sponsered by Capital One. Booked won first place out of 5 other projects. Note, it's unfinished
